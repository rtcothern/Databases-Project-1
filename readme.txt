Project Criteria:
    All criteria are met. Page I1 is in a file called
    addPerson.php. Page I2 is in addMovie.php. Page I3
    is in addReview.php. Page I4 and I5 are in
    addMoviePerson.php. Page B1 is in viewActor.php. Page
    B2 is in viewMovie.php. Page S1 is in search.php.

    Many additional features were implemented, primarily
    related to styling. Notably, when adding a person, if
    that person is selected as a director, then the sex
    field is grayed out, since directors have no gender.
    As well, in the page to associate a person with a movie,
    javascript is used to allow two dropdowns that are
    shown at different times based on a radio button selected
    by the user. As well, the pages to browse movie and
    actor information have dropdowns to select the target.
    Finally, the page to add a review to a movie has a
    dropdown to select the movie and also has the ability
    to specify the movie in a GET request.

Collaboration:
    Part of the time, we collaborated by working together
    on the same computer and writing code on-and-off.
    We then decided to divide the code on our own and
    used GitHub in order to synchronize our work. In a
    team setting, we can improve better by talking about
    the spec more so we can clear out any ambiguities
    immediately.

    Please note that we have included a small PHP library
    called 'ti.php' that makes it easier to have a similar
    theme on many web pages. We do not take credit for
    this file. All other files have been written by us.
